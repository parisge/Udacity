## Data Visualization: Performance of 6 Largest U.S. Domestic Carriers from 2003 to 2016
by Paris Georgoudis

### Summary

This project visualized the top 20% quartile of the performance for the years 2003-2016 for the largest U.S. domestic airlines' performance from 2003-2016.  It depicts 3 charts the percentage of On-Time arrivals, the percentage of Delays (over 15 mins) due to Carrier and the average minute of Delays (over 15 mins) per Carrer. All data was collected from RITA.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis and Cleaning (R)

I downloaded the data from [RITA](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/ot_delaycause1.asp?display=download&pn=0&month=1&year=2016). Since June 2003, the airlines report on-time data also report the causes of delays and cancellations to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Please see below the structure and summary of the database which was conducted using **Rstudio** and is found in detail in `data/data.Rmd` and `data/data.html`. While studying the data, I hypothesized that there might be trends in individual airline performance that can be extracted from the data. I decided that a line chart with multiple series would best show these different trends across different airlines.


##Initial Analysis


![Initial R Plot](https://github.com/parisge/Udacity/US Flights Visualization/images/ontime_all.png)

The chart above shows my initial run to display the performance of US domestic flights in terms of their carrier on time arrival. This is such a busy figure with 28 airlines and obviously it too cluttered in delivering analysis. For the next step, I will pick only the top 20% airlines based on the yearly average arrival flights number. 

## Final Visualizations

The selected (top 20%) carriers for visualization are :

```
## [1] "American Airlines Inc."   "Delta Air Lines Inc."    
## [3] "SkyWest Airlines Inc."   "American Eagle Inc."
## [5] "Southwest Airlines Co."   "United Air Lines Inc."
```

In this project the objective is to:

To show the performance of carriers, I will aggregate data by *year* and *carrier name* and use different metrics to see how they perform over time.

The charts used will be a combination of catter plot and line chart. Using point, I can precisly display the measure and audience can easily compare. Also, I will add lines to be able to show trends of the performance and for them to see how perfomance of each carrier changed over time.

### Average Percentage of Arrivals On-Time

![% of Arrivals On-Time](https://github.com/parisge/Udacity/US Flights Visualization/images/ontime_carrier.png)

Based on the diagram, we see that the percentage for on-time flights has converged significantly during the years 2011-2012 and 2015. For 2016 we have data only for the first month so they chart results need to be taken with a grain of salt. It is also clear from the chart is that Delta Airlines is outperfomring its competitors in terms of On-Time completed flights, even though it ranked below others before 2011.

Now let's examinte whether it is the carriers mistake the cause of the late flights. There can be multiple cause of late flighs such as Security, Weather, National Aviation System, Aircraft arriving late. The Air Carrier delay is contributing on average only 5% of the 20% on average of the plane delays. 

### Average Percentage Delay due to Carrier

![% Delays due to Carrier](https://github.com/parisge/Udacity/US Flights Visualization/images/delays_carrier.png)

As we can see SkyWest a regional airline which partners up with United, American and Delta used to have the highest number of delayed flights due to the carrier, but has significantly dropped after 2007. In the last few years United and South West has seen an increasing number of flights getting delayed due to the carrier. 

### Average Time Delay due to Carrier

![Time Delay due to Carrier](https://github.com/parisge/Udacity/US Flights Visualization/images/timedelay_carrier.png)

What is very interesting is that the average time of delay attributed to each carrier shows a very different picture than the Percentage of On-Time Arrivals and the Percentage of Delays due to Carrier. Delta Airlines that had on of the best records in terms of Arrivales and lowest in terms of Carrier Delays has on average the highest amount of minutes of delay. The trend on the average number of minutes of delay has been upwards, maybe because the Carriers are engaging in longer distance flights. Similarly SkyWest which saw it's Percentage Delay due to Carrier drop after 2007, it has see its Time Delay increase consistently after 2009. 


## Feedback
I showed the charts to couple of my friends and here are the main comments that I got back:


1 - "By looking at the On-Time flight rates chart, there is significant difference between carriers, however, the way you scaled the y axis doesn't really deliever the point! "

The range for percentage of on-time flight is between 70 and 90%. The diagram initially had y axis from (0 to 100%) which made a lot of empty space in the chart and also the difference of perfromance among the carriers were not really visible. I shortened the range from (0,100) to (60,90) so the difference become more obvious. 

2- "Even though the lines and points are colored differently, I think it would be really nice to highlight or emphasize individual airlines when you select them."

I added a `mouseover` event for the lines, so it would 'pop' it out and emphasize the path.  This would allow for better understanding of each individual airline's trend from 2003 to 2016.


3- "In the first chart the grid lines that come vertically to the x-axis stop at the 70% level. It would be nice to go all the way down to the x-axis."


4- Having the right side of the chart open was nice, in addition to the points being spread apart; it was clear to see who the current champion is. It would be better to have more explanatory titles to the charts."

I changed the chart title to be more consistent with the data presented.

5- "In some of the charts the legend gets clustered with the data."

I decided to move the legend to the top right, providing close proximity to the more relevant data points near 2014.

6- "There is not a story behind the graphs. It is more Explpraatory than Explanatory"

In the new version, I focused on Delta Air Lines and how it performs comparing to other carriers. I believe Delta Air Lines is currently one of the best US Domestic Air Lines in terms of delay.


Following the feedback from the interviews, I implemented the following changes:

- I added a `mouseover` event for the lines, so it would 'pop' it out and emphasize the path.  This would allow for better understanding of each individual airline's trend from 2003 to 2014.
- I changed the chart title to be more consistent with the data presented.
- I subdued and muted the grid lines.
- I polished the tooltip variable names to be more natural.

I chose not to include the arrival data and raw numbers.  I didn't think that it was the focus of the chart, or had any impact on the understanding of airline on-time arrival rates.

Below is the final rendition of the data visualization:
